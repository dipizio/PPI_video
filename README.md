# Hydrogen bond network between the spike protein RBD domain and the ACE2 receptor
  
Protein-protein interface of the MD trajectory from Amaro lab (https://amarolab.ucsd.edu/covid19.php).</br>
RBD and ACE2 are represented as blue and green cartoons, respectively. Residues involved in H-bonds with occupancy between 20% and 60% are represented as licorice/bond radius 0.1, whereas residues involved in H-bonds with occupancy higher than 60% are represented as licorice/bond radius 0.3. H-bonds are shown as magenta dashed lines.</br>
