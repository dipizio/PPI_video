# Dynamic H-bond network between the spike protein RBD domain and the ACE2 receptor
  

RBD and ACE2 are represented as blue and green cartoons, respectively. Residues involved in H-bonds with occupancy between 20% and 60% are represented as licorice/bond radius 0.1, whereas residues involved in H-bonds with occupancy higher than 60% are represented as licorice/bond radius 0.3. H-bonds are shown as magenta dashed lines.   _Video by Alessandro Nicoli, Leibniz-Institute for Food Systems Biology at the Technical University of Munich_</br>
